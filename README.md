# TensorFlowObjectDetectionTutorial
 

This is a "short" (rather lengthy) tutorial that started off as self notes on how to set-up and get going with the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

There currently exist several versions of the tutorial, corresponding to the various different versions of TensorFlow. The two major versions are outlined below.

## TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API tutorial 

[![TensorFlow 2.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-2.5-FF6F00?logo=tensorflow)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.5.0) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/badge/?version=latest)](http://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Since July 10, 2020 TensorFlow [announced that the Object Detection API officially supports TensorFlow 2](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/07/tensorflow-2-meets-object-detection-api.html). Therefore, an updated version of the tutorial was created to cover TensorFlow 2.

## TensorFlow Object Detection API tutorial 

[![TensorFlow 1.14](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-1.14-FF6F00?logo=tensorflow)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.14.0) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/badge/?version=tensorflow-1.14)](http://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/tensorflow-1.14/?badge=tensorflow-1.14)

Originally, the tutorial was written with TensorFlow 1 in mind. Since it is possible that many users will still be interested in working with TensorFlow 1, a version of this tutorial will also be maintained for the foreseeable future.
